# Advent of Code 2023 #

This is my first year participating in the Advent of Code. I've wanted to join in on the fun since I heard about it while I was still in university but I could never find the time to participate. This year I will be using these challenges to make sure my programming skills stay sharp as well as branch into languages I don't have much experience in. Most of my solutions will be in C++20 as I am trying to learn and get better with this language in particular.

If you're also interested in participating in Advent of Code you can find it here:

All of my solutions are easiest to run by using the g++ compiler at the command line as so:

`g++ -std=c++2a <solution-file> -o <output-file> && ./<output-file>`

e.g.

`g++ -std=c++2a day1.cc -o day1.out && ./day1.out`

Make sure you are in the proper directory before trying to compile.
